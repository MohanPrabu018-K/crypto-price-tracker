Crypto Price Tracker is a real-time cryptocurrency tracking web application built using Flask for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend. It fetches live data from the CoinGecko API and displays the top 100 cryptocurrencies with their current price, 24-hour price change, and market details. The interface is clean, modern, and fully responsive for both web and mobile users. It features a dynamic search bar for quickly filtering coins, live price color animations to indicate changes, and a detailed modal view for each coin. The backend handles smart caching to ensure smooth performance and frequent updates without heavy API load. This project combines Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a simple yet powerful tool for tracking market movements in real time.
